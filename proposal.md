## mood.

# mood is a web app that plays music, and suggests drinks to pair with the mood

* The page is going to open with 4 options, when you click one, the theme changes, and a playlist specific to the mood starts to play. A few drink options will be shown to the user, and they can also input a drink name and get the recipe and other useful information related to their drink choice. 

* We are using soundcloud API for the playists, and there will be music player controls on the page.
* https://developers.soundcloud.com/

* The drink information is from thecocktailDB
* https://www.thecocktaildb.com/

* We will be using foundation CSS framework
* https://foundation.zurb.com/
